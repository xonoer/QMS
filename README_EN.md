An idea for car number plates.

Have you ever noticed in your life that when you park your car, you don't have to have a spot, and then you park it to block other cars?

Put yourself in a position where your car is blocked?
I rent a house in a residential area in Beijing. The supply of parking Spaces is tight and sometimes I have to park next to other cars. At first, I also bought a car number plate, which has aged away.

 decisive search taobao has put type number card, but also with mobile phone bracket (heart along while, almost chopped off the hand to buy, but there is no use.
I'm more of an advocate of minimalist features and money saving.
Please friends calm think about their own car and buy this buy that, the maintenance cost is not small every year.
Taobao sells car to put number card in 9-60 of have, a few dollars accidentally also love dearly of not line not line.

Speaking of this small but useful code, I applied a small function of the QRCode plug-in. This program with no more than 20 lines of code was printed on a piece of paper.

(brainstorming)

I had a brainstorming session with my friends.

A: add your own portrait in the middle, or design the two-dimensional code prettily, and put the static sticker next to the inspection label, which will be pretty and cool.

B: I agree. Otherwise, the black and white qr code is very obtuse and ugly. Wait a minute, what if the prompt box for making a call automatically pops up when scanning?
Save yourself the trouble of pressing the keyboard. Why not?

C: I just tried it. The camera of iphone has built-in recognition. Android is not allowed.

Me: yeah, it can be done recently.
A: can't you move when you see this?
Submit your idea and join us!

D: why don't you think outside the box?
Do two-dimensional code name card, after scanning with a variety of hanging Fried day effect, title

I: right, not limited to car information, business CARDS, advertising can be added.

Do you have better ideas and ideas?
As with travel, thinking about waiting until you have time to go has failed.
Be an action person and go on a trip that belongs to you.
